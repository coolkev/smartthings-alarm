=================

Integrate existing hard-wired alarm sensors with SmartThings using an Arduino ThingShield

1. Add virtual Device Type - select "Open/Closed Sensor" from the Device Type Examples
2. Install Smart App
3. Upload sketch to Arduino
4. Connect each zone of your hardwired alarm sensors to a breadboard. 
All of the common wires should go to ground, and each zone wire should go to ports on the arduino (0,5,7,8,9,10,11,12) corresponding with zone 1-8
